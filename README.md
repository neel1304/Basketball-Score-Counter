This is a Live Basketball Score counter Application made as a course-project for Udacity-Android Basics Course.
 
Free Throw
Each free throw made counts as one point. The free-throw line is located 15 feet from the backboard in the center of the floor. For you to receive a free throw, the opposing team will have to commit a foul on you as you shoot or commit more than five personal fouls over the course of one quarter. If you are fouled as you sink a basket during game play, you will receive one bonus free throw. If you miss the shot, you will receive two or three free throws, depending on the location where the shot originated.

Two-Point Shot
Any basket from a shot taken from inside the three-point line during game play counts for two points. The three-point line is located 23 feet 9 inches from the center of the backboard. If a player steps on the three-point line before releasing the ball, the shot will count for only two points.

Three-Point Shot
Any basket from a shot taken from outside the three-point line counts for three points. The shooting player can step on or cross the three-point line after releasing the ball; the shot will still count for three points. The shooter must have at least one foot on the floor outside of the line before taking the shot.
